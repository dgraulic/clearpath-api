For many of us, the regular practice of yoga can lift the mood, reduce stress, enhance problem-solving, improve strength and flexibility, lessen fatigue and increase energy.\n\nA typical YMW class at The Breathing Project involves the slow, careful movement of yoga postures, focused breathing coordinated with movement, attention to the present moment, embodied exploration of the body and its resources, compassionate self-care and deep relaxation.  YMW classes at The Breathing Project are limited to 8 students to allow for individualized teaching, the growth of connections between student, teacher and classmates, and the development of healing communities.\n\nTuesdays: 10:30am-11:45am\nThursdays: 10:30am-11:45am\nMust Register in Advance Through Email or Phone",
