Vita then analyzes the root causes of challenging behaviors in different areas of development including emotional, social, and physical development, and how these behaviors can be detrimental to a child’s success and their development in all stages of life.\n\nStudents will learn to identify these challenging behaviors through observation and by contacting and working with professionals with assessments.  Class participants then apply strategies to prevent and reduce challenging behaviors and develop healthy social emotional intelligence in children with long term and short term goals.",
